  <h2>About this proyect ✨</h2>
  <h3>
    UVaEats is a university project developed by a group of four people. This has been my first project in which I have had the freedom to choose the topic to work on. 
    Together with my group, we were inspired by an aspect of university life that we believe could be improved.
